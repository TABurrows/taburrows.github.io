## AI in Google Cloud

Types of learning:
Supervised = labelled data; learns from past values to predict future valuew
Unsupervised = unlabelled data; unsupervised problems include dicscoverey, tagging data, how data falls into groups


### Neural Networks

Can use both Supervised and Unsupervised learning



Generative Model: generates new data instances from the learned conditional probability distribution (joint probability):
    - generates new content based on past content
    - output is:
        - natural language
        - image
        - audio
        - video

Discriminative model: for classification or prediction, discriminate between
    - output is:
        number
        discrete
        class
        probability



Training results in a STATISTICAL MODEL.
