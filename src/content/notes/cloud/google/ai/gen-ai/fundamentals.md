## Gen AI on Google Cloud

### Fundamentals

- Artificial Intelligence: building machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence such as learning, problem-solving and decision-making

- Machine Learning: a subfield of AI where machines learn from data to perform specific tasks

- Generative AI: a subset of and an application of Machine Learning that focuses on creating new content

- Deep learning: a subset of ML that uses artificial neural networks with many layers to extract complex patterns from data

- Foundation models: powerful ML models trained on massive amounts of unlabeled data, allowing them to develop a broad understanding of the world

- Large Language Models: a type of Foundation Model that is designed to understand and generate human language


### Generative AI

A type of AI that can create new content.  Gen AI applications can  be Multimodal, enabling them to process and generate different types of data like text, images and code simultaneously.

- Create: Generate new content

- Summarize: Condense information into concise summaries

- Discover: Find information at the right time

- Automate: Automate previously manual tasks


### Foundation Models

Large AI models trained on massive datasets, allowing them to be adapted to many tasks.  They are the basis model of Gen AI.

- Trained on diverse data
- Flexible to a wide range of use cases
- Adaptable to specialized domains through additional targeted training

### Prompting

Is the methdo of interacting with Founation models and guiding them.  It involves providing them with instructions or inputs to generate desired outputs.

### Prompt Engineering

The art and science of creating effective inputs, known as prompt, for generative AI models to Maximize their value and tailor responses to specific needs.
