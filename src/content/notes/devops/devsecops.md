DevSecOps is a process that integrates CyberSecurity processes into all phases of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), from writing code to deployment.

DevSecOps helps organizations reduce the risk of releasing code with security vulnerabilities and improves incident and problem response.

### Principles

__Shift Left__: where CyberSecurity process are incoporated into the very beginning of the development process, during the writing of code.\*

__Collaboration__: Development, security and operations teams work together to share responsibility for CyberSecurity.

__Automation__: automated security checks are integrated into the DevOps workflow.

__Security Testing__: security testing and evaluation is performed at every stage of development.

__Security Audits__: active security audits are integrated into the development process.

__Security Issues__: CyberSecurity issues are addressed as soon as they are identified.

\* Some examples of security procedures that can be used during the coding phase:
- Code Reviews
- Static Code Analysis
- Pre-commit hooks (linting, auditing, analyzing, scanning)
