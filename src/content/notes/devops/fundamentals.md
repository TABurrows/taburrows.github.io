A DevOps culture encourages a product mindset and helps a developer get closer to the user by gaining a better understanind of user requirements and needs.

Operations teams get involved in the development process and add maintenance requirements and customer needs.  


## Principles

__Collaboration__: DevOps means the collaboration of development and operations teams into a single unit to work across the entire application lifecycle.

__Automation__: an essential practice is to automate as much of the software development lifecycle as possible.

__Continuous Improvement__: Continuous Improvement (CI), from Agile practices, is the practice of focusing on experimentation, minimizing waster and optimizing for speed, cost and ease of delivery.

__Customer Centricity__: the use of short feedback-loops with customers and end users to develop products and services centered around user needs enables the rapid collection and response to customer feedback.

__Holisticity__: avoid having teams build-in-a-bubble or based on assumptions, instead a DevOps team will have a holistic understanding of the product from creation to implementation.



## Continuous

__Continuous Integration__: changes are merged back to the main branch as often as possible.  These changes are then validated by creating a build and running automated tests against the build.

__Continuous Delivery__: an extension of __Continuous Integration__, is the adoption of automation that deploys all code changes to a testing and/or production environment after the build stage.

__Continuous Deployment__: an extension of __Continuous Delivery__, is the adoption fo automation that releases code to customers once all stages of the production pipeline pass their tests.
