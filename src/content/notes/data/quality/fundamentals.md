## Metrics

Some metrics to gauge data quality might include:

- __Accuracy__: whether the data reflects the real world

- __Completeness__:  whether the data contains all required values

- __Consistency__: whether the data is uniform across networks and applications

- __Validity__: whether the data conforms to defined business rules and parameters

- __Uniqueness__: whether there are any duplications or overlapping of values

- __Availability__: whether the data is available when it is required

- __Timeliness__: whether the data is up-to-date with relation to processes

- __Freshness__: whether the data is up-to-date with relation to the present moment

- __Reliability__: whether the data contradicts other trusted resources

- __Relevance__: whether the data contains signal or noise


## Approaches

A data quality solution approach might involve:

- __Aggregate and Analyze__: apply validation rules to aggregate and analyze multiple data sets

- __Observability__: monitor and report on data issues, anomalies and data set comparisons

- __Modify__: modify data in-memory with an automated __Business Approval Process__

- __Write Back__: update source systems based on defined __Business Logic and Rules__
