## Data Curation

Data Curation can enable automated data discovery, advanced search and retrieval, improvement in the overall data quality, and increased data reuse.

__Collect__: Interface to the data sources and accept inputs
__Characterize__: Capture available Metadata
__Clean__: Identify and correct Data Quality issues
__Contextualize__: Provide context and provenance
__Categorize__: Fit within framewok that defines the problem domain
__Correlate__: Find relationships among the various data
__Catalogue__: Store and make data and metadata accessible with APIs for search and analysis

The benefits of Data Curation are a reduction in problem-solving time, improved data quality, increased confidence in solutions, reduced time and manual effort to perform the curation, and ability to solve problems that were previously too complex or time-consuming to solve.
